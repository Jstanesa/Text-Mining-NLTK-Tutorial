We will convert this text into a NLTK \"Text\" object, allowing us to use NLTK's built in functions to process the text."

Import the \"urllib\" library into your program, and then run some cryptic functions of the library to get a big string containing all of the text inside of the URL. We store this string inside of the \"raw\" variable. You can change the URL inside of the quotes to anything you like.\n"
